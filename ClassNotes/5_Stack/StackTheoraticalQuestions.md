## Stack Concepts

1. **What is a Stack, and how does it follow the LIFO principle?**
   - **Answer:** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added (pushed) is the first to be removed (popped). For example, in a stack of plates, you add and remove plates from the top, so the last plate placed is the first taken off.

2. **What are the basic operations of a Stack, and what are their time complexities?**
   - **Answer:** The basic operations are:
     - **Push:** Add an element to the top (O(1) for array/linked list).
     - **Pop:** Remove the top element (O(1) for array/linked list).
     - **Peek (or Top):** View the top element without removing it (O(1)).
     - **IsEmpty:** Check if the stack is empty (O(1)).
     Time complexities assume a simple array or linked list implementation without resizing constraints.

3. **How does a Stack differ from a Queue?**
   - **Answer:** A Stack follows LIFO (Last-In-First-Out), where elements are added and removed from the same end (top), like a pile of books. A Queue follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out), where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front, like a line of people. For example, pushing 1, 2, 3 onto a Stack and popping gives 3 first, while dequeuing from a Queue gives 1 first.

4. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a Stack using an array vs. a linked list?**
   - **Answer:**
     - **Array:**
       - **Advantages:** Fast access to the top (O(1)), memory-efficient due to contiguous storage.
       - **Disadvantages:** Fixed size (unless resized, which is O(n)), potential overflow if too many elements are pushed.
     - **Linked List:**
       - **Advantages:** Dynamic size, no overflow as it grows with memory availability.
       - **Disadvantages:** Extra memory for pointers, slightly slower due to node overhead.

5. **What happens when you try to pop an element from an empty Stack?**
   - **Answer:** Popping from an empty Stack results in a condition called "underflow." Typically, an error or exception is raised, or a special value (e.g., null) is returned, depending on the implementation. For example, a program might display "Stack Underflow" to indicate no elements are available to remove.

6. **What are some real-world applications of Stacks?**
   - **Answer:** Stacks are used in:
     - **Function Call Management:** Track function calls and returns in a call stack.
     - **Undo/Redo Operations:** Store previous states (e.g., in text editors).
     - **Expression Evaluation:** Parse and evaluate expressions (e.g., postfix notation).
     - **Browser History:** Manage back/forward navigation by pushing page visits.

7. **What is the significance of the "top" pointer in a Stack?**
   - **Answer:** The "top" pointer indicates the current top element of the Stack, where push and pop operations occur. In an array implementation, it’s an index; in a linked list, it’s a pointer to the head node. It’s crucial for tracking the Stack’s state—e.g., `top = -1` (array) or `top = null` (linked list) means the Stack is empty.

8. **How does recursion use a Stack implicitly?**
   - **Answer:** Recursion uses the system’s call stack to manage function calls. Each recursive call pushes a new frame onto the call stack with local variables and return address. When the base case is reached, frames are popped off as functions return, mimicking a Stack’s LIFO behavior. For example, calculating factorial(5) pushes frames for 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, then pops them to compute the result.

9. **What is Stack Overflow, and what causes it?**
   - **Answer:** Stack Overflow occurs when a Stack exceeds its allocated memory, typically in an array-based implementation with a fixed size or during excessive recursion. Causes include pushing too many elements beyond capacity or infinite recursion without a base case, exhausting the call stack. For example, a recursive function without termination can crash with "Stack Overflow."

10. **Can a Stack be used to reverse a sequence? If so, how?**
    - **Answer:** Yes, a Stack can reverse a sequence due to its LIFO nature. To reverse a sequence (e.g., a string "ABC"), push all elements onto the Stack ("C" on top), then pop them off ("C", "B", "A"), yielding the reversed order ("CBA"). This works because the last element in becomes the first out.

11. **What is the difference between a Stack and a Heap in memory management?**
    - **Answer:** A Stack is a data structure (LIFO) and a memory region for function calls and local variables, managed automatically with fixed allocation. The Heap is a memory region for dynamic allocation (e.g., via `malloc` or `new`), managed manually or by a garbage collector, unrelated to the Stack data structure. For example, a function’s variables live on the stack, while a dynamically created object lives on the heap.

12. **Why is a Stack considered a restrictive data structure?**
    - **Answer:** A Stack is restrictive because it only allows access to the top element, limiting operations to push and pop at one end. Unlike arrays or lists, you cannot access or modify elements in the middle or bottom without popping everything above, making it less flexible but efficient for specific use cases like backtracking.

13. **How does a Stack support postfix expression evaluation?**
    - **Answer:** In postfix (reverse Polish) notation (e.g., "3 4 +"), operands appear before operators. A Stack evaluates it by pushing operands (3, 4), then popping them (4, 3) when an operator (+) is encountered, performing the operation (3 + 4 = 7), and pushing the result back. This continues until the expression is fully processed, leveraging LIFO to handle nested operations.

14. **What are the trade-offs of using a Stack for memory management in programming languages?**
    - **Answer:**
      - **Advantages:** Fast allocation/deallocation (O(1)), automatic cleanup (LIFO matches function scope), no fragmentation.
      - **Disadvantages:** Limited size (fixed stack memory), no persistence (data is lost on pop/return), risk of overflow with deep recursion.

15. **How can a Stack be used to check for balanced parentheses in an expression?**
    - **Answer:** A Stack checks balanced parentheses (e.g., "{[()]}") by pushing opening symbols (e.g., "{", "[", "(") onto the Stack. When a closing symbol (e.g., ")") appears, pop the top and check if it matches (e.g., "(" for ")"). If the Stack is empty at the end and all matches succeed, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it’s unbalanced (e.g., unmatched symbols or leftover elements).
