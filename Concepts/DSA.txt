Data Structure:
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, managing, and storing data in a way that enables 
efficient access and modification. It provides a systematic way of solving problems and optimizing algorithms 
by using well-organized data.

Developing of software:
--> purpose/problem statement 
--> Solution
--> Algorithm
--> Pseudocode
--> Program/Source code (executable code)
--> Documentation
--> Testing
--> Deployment
--> Maintenance
--> Evaluation
--> Feedback
--> Improvement

Algorithm:
An algorithm is a well-defined procedure that takes some input and produces a corresponding output. It is a
step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a computation. Algorithms are used to solve problems
efficiently and effectively.
It is usually written in plain, natural language or represented graphically using flowcharts.

Pseudocode:
Pseudocode is a simplified, informal, and language-agnostic way of writing an algorithm. It resembles a mix of natural language and programming syntax to bridge the gap between an algorithm and actual code.

DSA operates data and organized it.

Difference between software and Program
Software is a collection of programs,documentation and Data that are used to perform a specific task or set 
of tasks. A program is a set of instructions that a computer can execute to perform a specific task.

Software is the code that operates on Data.

Flowchart:
Algorithm is represented graphically using flowcharts. It is a diagram that shows the steps of an algorithm in
a visual way. It is used to represent the flow of control in a program.

The American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) set standards for
flowcharts and their symbols
