There are different ways to detect a cycle in a linked list. Here are some common methods:
### 1. Hash Set Method
**Description**: Use a hash set to store visited nodes and check for duplicates.
- **Detection**: Traverse the list and add each node's memory address (or reference) to a hash set. If a node is already in the set, a cycle exists.
- **Finding Start of Cycle**: The node that is already in the set is the start of the cycle.
- **Removal**: Traverse the list again to find the node before the cycle start and set its `next` pointer to `None`.

**Complexity**:
- **Time**: O(n) - single traversal of the list.
- **Space**: O(n) - stores up to n nodes in the hash set.

**Pros**:
- Simple to understand and implement.
- Directly gives the cycle start point during detection.
- Works for any cycle length.

**Cons**:
- Requires extra space (O(n)), unlike Floyd's O(1) space.
- Slightly slower due to hash operations.

### 2. Marking Visited Nodes (Destructive Method)
**Description**: Modify the list nodes by adding a "visited" flag or changing a pointer temporarily to mark nodes as visited.
- **Detection**: Traverse the list, marking each node. If a marked node is encountered, a cycle exists.
- **Finding Start of Cycle**: The marked node encountered again is the start.
- **Removal**: Reset the mark and break the cycle by setting the appropriate `next` pointer to `None`.

**Complexity**:
- **Time**: O(n) - single traversal for detection and optional reset.
- **Space**: O(1) - no extra data structure, but modifies the node structure.

**Pros**:
- Space-efficient like Floyd's algorithm (O(1) extra space).
- Simple logic.

**Cons**:
- Requires modifying the node structure (adding a flag), which may not be allowed.
- If resetting flags is needed, requires an additional O(n) traversal.

### 3. Reverse Pointer Method
**Description**: Reverse the list's pointers as you traverse it. If you encounter the head again, there's a cycle.
- **Detection**: Reverse each node's `next` pointer to point to the previous node. If you return to the head, a cycle exists.
- **Finding Start of Cycle**: Track the last node before returning to head.
- **Removal**: Reverse the list back and break the cycle.

**Complexity**:
- **Time**: O(n) - one traversal to detect, optional O(n) to reverse back.
- **Space**: O(1) - no extra space.

**Pros**:
- Space-efficient (O(1)).
- Works without additional data structures.

**Cons**:
- Complex and destructive (modifies the list structure).
- Requires careful handling to restore the original list.

### 4. Brute Force (Counting Method)
**Description**: Count nodes up to a large limit; if the count exceeds the possible length, a cycle exists.
- **Detection**: Traverse the list and count nodes. If the count exceeds a reasonable maximum (e.g., 10^6), assume a cycle.
- **Finding Start of Cycle**: Requires additional logic (e.g., hash set).
- **Removal**: Similar to other methods after identifying the cycle.

**Complexity**:
- **Time**: O(n) or O(k) where k is the max count.
- **Space**: O(1) or O(n) if combined with a hash set.

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement for detection.

**Cons**:
- Not reliable (assumes a maximum length).
- Inefficient for finding the cycle start or removing it without additional structures.

### Comparison to Floyd's Tortoise and Hare
| Method              | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Modifies List | Key Advantage             | Key Disadvantage          |
|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Floyd's Algorithm   | O(n)            | O(1)             | No            | Optimal time and space    | Slightly complex logic    |
| Hash Set            | O(n)            | O(n)             | No            | Simple and intuitive      | Uses extra space          |
| Marking Nodes       | O(n)            | O(1)             | Yes           | Space-efficient           | Requires node modification|
| Reverse Pointer     | O(n)            | O(1)             | Yes           | No extra space            | Complex and destructive   |
| Brute Force Counting| O(n) or O(k)    | O(1)             | No            | Very simple detection     | Unreliable, incomplete    |

### When to Use Alternatives?
- **Hash Set**: When simplicity is preferred and extra space is available.
- **Marking Nodes**: When node modification is allowed and space is a constraint.
- **Reverse Pointer**: When you need O(1) space and can afford to modify the list temporarily.
- **Brute Force**: Rarely practical; mostly for quick-and-dirty detection.

Floyd's algorithm remains the gold standard due to its balance of efficiency (O(n) time, O(1) space) and non-destructive nature, but these alternatives can be useful depending on specific constraints or requirements.
