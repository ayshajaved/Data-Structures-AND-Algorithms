## General Queue Concepts

1. **What is a Queue, and how does it follow the FIFO principle?**
   - **Answer:** A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added (enqueued) is the first to be removed (dequeued). For example, in a line at a ticket counter, the person who arrives first gets served first.

2. **What are the basic operations of a Queue, and what are their time complexities?**
   - **Answer:** The basic operations are:
     - **Enqueue:** Add an element to the rear (O(1) for array/linked list).
     - **Dequeue:** Remove an element from the front (O(1) for array/linked list).
     - **Peek:** View the front element without removing it (O(1)).
     - **IsEmpty:** Check if the queue is empty (O(1)).
     Time complexities assume a simple array or linked list implementation without resizing constraints.

3. **How does a Queue differ from a Stack?**
   - **Answer:** A Queue follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out), where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front, like a line of people. A Stack follows LIFO (Last-In-First-Out), where elements are added and removed from the same end, like a stack of plates. For example, in a Queue, if you add 1, 2, 3, you dequeue 1 first; in a Stack, you pop 3 first.

4. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a Queue using an array vs. a linked list?**
   - **Answer:**
     - **Array:**
       - **Advantages:** Fast access (O(1) for front/rear), memory-efficient due to contiguous storage.
       - **Disadvantages:** Fixed size (unless resized, which is O(n)), wasted space after dequeuing (unless circular).
     - **Linked List:**
       - **Advantages:** Dynamic size, no wasted space, grows as needed.
       - **Disadvantages:** Slower access (O(1) but with pointer overhead), more memory due to node pointers.

5. **What is a Circular Queue, and how does it solve the problem of wasted space in a regular Queue?**
   - **Answer:** A Circular Queue is a variation of a regular Queue where the rear pointer wraps around to the beginning when it reaches the end of the array, forming a "circle." In a regular array-based Queue, dequeuing shifts elements forward, leaving unused space at the front. A Circular Queue reuses this space by connecting the end to the start, improving space efficiency.

## Priority Queue Concepts

6. **What is a Priority Queue, and how does it differ from a regular Queue?**
   - **Answer:** A Priority Queue is a data structure where each element has a priority, and elements are dequeued based on priority (e.g., highest or lowest) rather than order of insertion. Unlike a regular Queue (FIFO), a Priority Queue removes the element with the highest/lowest priority first. For example, in a hospital, patients with critical conditions are treated before others, regardless of arrival time.

7. **What is the difference between a Min-Heap and a Max-Heap in a Priority Queue?**
   - **Answer:** In a Priority Queue:
     - **Min-Heap:** The smallest element has the highest priority and is at the root; dequeuing removes the minimum (e.g., for shortest job scheduling).
     - **Max-Heap:** The largest element has the highest priority and is at the root; dequeuing removes the maximum (e.g., for highest-priority tasks).
     The heap property ensures parent-child priority ordering.

8. **What are the time complexities of operations in a Priority Queue implemented with a binary heap?**
   - **Answer:**
     - **Insert (Enqueue):** O(log n) – Adds an element and "bubbles it up" to maintain heap property.
     - **Extract-Min/Max (Dequeue):** O(log n) – Removes the root and "heapifies" down to reorder.
     - **Peek:** O(1) – Accesses the root without modification.
     - **Heapify:** O(log n) – Adjusts the heap after insertion/removal.
     These assume a binary heap implementation.

9. **How does a Priority Queue handle elements with equal priority?**
   - **Answer:** When elements have equal priority, the Priority Queue typically follows the order of insertion (FIFO) within that priority level, ensuring stability. However, this depends on implementation; some may use secondary criteria (e.g., timestamp) or leave it undefined, processing them arbitrarily.

10. **What are some real-world applications of Priority Queues?**
    - **Answer:** Priority Queues are used in:
      - **Task Scheduling:** Operating systems prioritize tasks (e.g., shorter jobs first).
      - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Finds shortest paths in graphs by processing nodes with smallest distance first.
      - **Huffman Coding:** Builds optimal prefix codes using a min-heap of frequencies.
      - **Event Simulations:** Processes events in chronological order (e.g., network packets).

## Deque Concepts

11. **What is a Deque (Double-Ended Queue), and how does it differ from a regular Queue?**
    - **Answer:** A Deque (Double-Ended Queue) allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends (front and rear), unlike a regular Queue, which only supports enqueue at the rear and dequeue from the front. For example, a Deque can act as both a Queue (rear-in, front-out) and a Stack (rear-in, rear-out), offering more flexibility.

12. **What are the time complexities of Deque operations?**
    - **Answer:** For an array-based or doubly linked list-based Deque:
      - **PushFront:** O(1) – Add to front.
      - **PushBack:** O(1) – Add to rear.
      - **PopFront:** O(1) – Remove from front.
      - **PopBack:** O(1) – Remove from rear.
      These assume no resizing (for arrays) or efficient pointer management (for linked lists).

13. **When would you use a Deque instead of a Queue or Stack?**
    - **Answer:** A Deque is preferred when operations at both ends are needed:
      - **Sliding Window Problems:** Track max/min in a window (e.g., maximum in subarrays).
      - **Palindrome Checking:** Compare elements from both ends efficiently.
      - **Undo/Redo Systems:** Add/remove operations from either end (like browser history).

## Circular Queue Concepts

14. **How does a Circular Queue differ from a regular Queue in implementation?**
    - **Answer:** A Circular Queue uses a fixed-size array with front and rear pointers that wrap around to the beginning when they reach the end, unlike a regular Queue, where the front pointer moves forward, leaving unused space. In a Circular Queue, if rear reaches the array’s end and space exists at the front, it resets to 0, enabling reuse.

15. **What are the conditions for a Circular Queue to be full or empty?**
    - **Answer:**
      - **Empty:** When `front == -1` (initially) or `front == rear + 1` (after dequeuing all elements), indicating no elements remain.
      - **Full:** When `(rear + 1) % size == front`, meaning the rear pointer, after wrapping, meets the front, and no more space is available.
      These conditions rely on modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature.
