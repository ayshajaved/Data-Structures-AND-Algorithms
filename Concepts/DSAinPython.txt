Python has inbuilt Data structures which are used to store and manipulate data. These data structures are:

1. List
2. Tuple
3. Set
4. Dictionary

These data structures are used to store data in a specific way and can be used to perform various operations on the data.
List:
A list is a collection of items which are ordered and changeable. It is written with square brackets [].
Example:
python
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
Tuple:
A tuple is a collection of items which are ordered and unchangeable. It is written with round brackets().
Example:
python
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
Set:
A set is a collection of items which are unordered and unchangeable. It is written with curly brackets {}.
Example:
python
```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```
Dictionary:
A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. It is written with curly brackets {} and each key-value pair is separated by a colon :.
Example:
python
```python
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
``` 
These are the basic data structures in Python which are used to store and manipulate data.
These are called as ADT (Abstract Data Type)

ADT:
ADT is a theoretical concept in computer science which describes the behavior of a data structure without specifying its implementation. It is a way to define the properties and operations of a data structure without worrying about the underlying implementation.

An abstraction is a mechanism for separating uses and implementation of an object.
Two common types of abstractions
procedural or functional abstraction
and data abstraction.

procedural abstracton:
The procedural abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details of a procedure or function from the user.

Data abstraction:
The data abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details of a data structure from the user.

ADT are used by set of operations called interface
