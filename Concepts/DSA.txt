Data Structure:
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, managing, and storing data in a way that enables 
efficient access and modification. It provides a systematic way of solving problems and optimizing algorithms 
by using well-organized data.

Algorithm:
An algorithm is a well-defined procedure that takes some input and produces a corresponding output. It is a
step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a computation. Algorithms are used to solve problems
efficiently and effectively.

DSA operates data and organized it.

Difference between software and Program
Software is a collection of programs,documentation and Data that are used to perform a specific task or set 
of tasks. A program is a set of instructions that a computer can execute to perform a specific task.

Software is the code that operates on Data
